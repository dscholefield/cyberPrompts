# cyberPrompts

ChatGPT and other LLM prompts (one per file) I have found useful over the last few years as a cyber security professional.

Free to use and improve, each prompt has a description, what I have tried to achieve from usnig the pronpt, issues and problems, and possible improvements etc.

Notes:

The 'template' file is contentless and is used to create prompt files.
